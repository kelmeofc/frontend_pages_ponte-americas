# Specification Quality Checklist: Custom Cursor Visual Effect

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-11-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - The specification focuses entirely on user experience and visual behavior without mentioning specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are clearly defined with:
- 10 functional requirements covering all aspects of the cursor behavior
- 4 non-functional requirements for performance and compatibility
- Measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- Comprehensive edge cases identified
- Clear assumptions documented

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - The feature is well-scoped with:
- Three prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) that can be implemented independently
- Each story has clear acceptance scenarios
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Scope is limited to visual cursor effects only (no additional functionality)

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All quality criteria met on first validation
- No clarifications needed - all requirements are clear and unambiguous
- The feature scope is well-defined and focused on visual enhancement only
