# Specification Quality Checklist: Reusable Landing Page Component

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on what needs to be achieved (reusable component, individual program pages) without specifying how to implement it. No framework-specific details in requirements.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - All 10 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic. Edge cases cover important scenarios like missing data and invalid URLs.

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - Three user stories with clear priorities (P1, P2) provide independent test scenarios. Each story can be developed and tested independently. Success criteria provide clear measurable outcomes.

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All validation items passed on first review
- No clarifications needed - requirements are clear and actionable
- Edge cases provide good coverage of potential issues
- User stories are properly prioritized with P1 items being foundational
